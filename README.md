<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

All you need is a youtube video link that isn't shortened!

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.8.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/)
* The [Tkinter](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) library
* The [pytube](https://pypi.org/project/pytube/) library

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/squarepusher03/youtubeDownloader.git
```
2. Install Python
3. Install tkinter and pytube with pip.

The `app.exe` executable should be in the `dist` folder. 
If you don't want to use it from that folder, just use a shortcut. 
You can also make a shortcut of the `downloads` folder if you'd like.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Launch the `app.exe` executable from the `dist` folder to start up the application.
Enter your YouTube video link address to the entry box and select your preferred resolution and 
filetype from the comboboxes. Don't forget to press the submit button, and your download will be
stored in the `downloads` folder in `dist`. On submitting, the video information will appear.
All downloads are deleted once the application is closed to reduce taking up too much space,
so don't forget to copy or move the files before you close the app.

If something were to go wrong with pytube and nothing changes on the form after submitting, simply press
the submit button again. You may also use shortcuts to make it easier. If the address box is left empty, 
it will default to an old cat video of mine, it will not download though. If there are no streams with the
preferred quality and file extension, it will default to a 360p mp4.
